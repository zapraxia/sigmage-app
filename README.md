# sigmage

## Inspiration <br/>

Many artists we know have complained that their work is being used without appropriate credit as other people claim to
be the original creaters. Sigmage is a tool that sets or gets a signature inside an image, so that we can easily access the
creater associated with each image. The signed image slightly alters the image data by encrypting a hidden signature using
a state of the art steganography algorithms. This addresses privacy concerns and allows original creaters of images to be
more assertive of their own work<br/><br/>

## What it does<br/>

Our solution is an app that signs images. You will be able to upload images through our web application and we will
return a signed image. The signed image is virtually indistinguishable from the original image. But when queried by this
library, it will be able to return a hidden signature. This can achieve preventions of fraud and provide hidden image
credentials.

## How we built it<br/>

The website was built using Django for backend, HTML/CSS/Javascript for frontend, and Bootstrap.
<br/><br/>

## Challenges we ran into<br/>

We as a group had to learn many new algorithms and library to assemble them into one coherent working project. The learning
process took a significant amount of time and effort.
<br/><br/>

## Accomplishments that we're proud of<br/>

We are proud of tackling an issue that people have highlighted as a concern. We learned about how to publish packages
using PyPI and gained experience in web development.
<br/><br/>

## What we learned <br/>

As we are a team consisting mostly of beginner programmers, this was a great way to learn web development with Django in
Python. We got to learn the difference between frontend and backend, how teams can collaborate on a coding project, and
apply critical and creative thinking skills to solve a real world problem.

## What's next for sigmage<br/>

It's pretty much done. It is a simple project.
