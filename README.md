## Inspiration
Many artists we know have complained that their work is being used without appropriate credit as other people claim to be the original creators. Signage is a tool that sets or gets a signature inside an image so that we can easily access the creator associated with each image. The signed image slightly alters the image data by encrypting a hidden signature using state of the art steganography algorithms. This addresses privacy concerns and allows original creators of images to be more assertive of their own work.

## What it does

Our solution allows you to upload images through our web application and obtain image signatures, or, set a new image signature. The signed image is virtually indistinguishable from the original image. But, when queried by this
library, it will be able to return a hidden signature. This can achieve preventions of fraud and provide hidden image
credentials.

## How we built it
This website is a full-stack web application using Django for its backend, and HTML/CSS (Bootstrap) for its frontend.

## Challenges we ran into
We as a group had to learn many new algorithms and libraries to assemble them into one coherent working project, as well as coming up with new ones. The learning and development process took a significant amount of time and effort.

## Accomplishments that we are proud of
We are proud of tackling an issue that people have highlighted as a concern. We learned about how to publish packages using PyPI and gained experience in web development.

## What I learned
As we are a team consisting mostly of beginner programmers, this was a great way to learn web development with Django in Python. We got to learn the difference between frontend and backend, how teams can collaborate on a coding project, and apply critical and creative thinking skills to solve a real-world problem.

## What's next for Sigmage
It's pretty much done. It is a simple project. But, we can work on improving the existing designs and GUI a little bit.
