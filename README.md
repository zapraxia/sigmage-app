# sigmage

## Inspiration <br/>

Many artists we know have complained that their work is being used without appropriate credit as other people claim to
be the original creaters. Sigmage is a tool that ensures that images are signed, so that we can easily access the
creater associated with each image. This addresses privacy concerns and allows original creaters of images to be more
assertive of their own work<br/><br/>

## What it does<br/>

Our solution is an app that signs images. You will be able to upload images through our web application and we will
return a signed image. The signed image is virtually indistinguishable from the original image. But when queried by this
library, it will be able to return a hidden signature. This can achieve preventions of fraud and provide hidden image
credentials.

## How we built it<br/>

The website was built using Django for backend, HTML/CSS/Javascript for frontend, and Bootstrap.
<br/><br/>

## Challenges we ran into<br/>

Having to deal with the guilt of making one member do all the work
<br/><br/>

## Accomplishments that we're proud of<br/>

We are proud of tackling an issue that people have highlighted as a concern. We learned about how to publish packages
using PyPI and gained experience in web development.
<br/><br/>

## What we learned <br/>

As we are a team consisting mostly of beginner programmers, this was a great way to learn web development with Django in
Python. We got to learn the difference between frontend and backend, how teams can collaborate on a coding project, and
apply critical and creative thinking skills to solve a real world problem.
